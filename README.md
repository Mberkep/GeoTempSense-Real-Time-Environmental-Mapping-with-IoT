The project's main goal is to create a custom mobile device with integrated sensors for real-time environmental data collection, particularly temperature and location. Utilizing Arduino UNO, ESP 8266-01 Wi-Fi Module, and NEO-6M GPS Module, the device captures and broadcasts data over Wi-Fi for processing and visualization on a PC. This facilitates the creation of a dynamic temperature map, useful in environmental monitoring, urban planning, and climate studies. The report details the design, development, and technical aspects of this IoT-enabled device, highlighting its practicality and efficiency in live data collection and analysis.
